Manage memberships at the network's main site (the primary domain of the network) and provide/restrict access on subsites in the network.

== Description ==

This add on allows you to sell memberships at the main site that provide access to members-only content on a site or sites throughout the entire multisite network.

All of the membership levels and users are managed on the main network site. The subsites look to the main network site's database to mirror the membership levels available and to check a user's access.

== Installation ==

1. Install Paid Memberships Pro via Network Admin > Plugins > Add New. Do not "Network Activate" the plugin.
1. On your main network site, activate and configure Paid Memberships Pro by following the Initial Plugin Setup guide.
1. Upload the 'pmpro-network-subsite' directory to the 'wp-content/plugins/' directory of your WordPress Multisite environment.
1. For each site in your network that has member content, navigate to the site's Dashboard > Plugins. Activate Paid Memberships Pro AND the Multisite Membership Add On.
1. DO NOT activate the 'pmpro-network-subsite' plugin on the “Main” site (i.e. where people checkout) of your network.
1. Make sure that the constant PMPRO_NETWORK_MAIN_DB_PREFIX is properly defined for your main network site in your wp-config.php file. For example: define('PMPRO_NETWORK_MAIN_DB_PREFIX', 'wp');

You will now be able to create members-only content on subsites in the network. The membership levels of your main site are mirrored in each subsite.
